# Generic Landing Page

This is my second project submission for The Odin Project curriculum. It is a landing webpage.

## What's New?
Looking back on my first attempt at building this page, I didn't understand Flexbox layout well. For a lot of elements, I basically slapped `display: flex;` on them and centered their children believing that was enough, which caused me to abuse other elements, like `padding`, and `width`. This time around, I think I utilized Flexbox in a better way, not only by applying `display: flex;` sparingly, but also by applying other Flexbox properties, like `gap`, `flex`, and `flex-wrap`. Now, I think the page is much more responsive, and even more pleasing to the eye.
